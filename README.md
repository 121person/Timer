# Timer
- This is a basic timer made in python
- It has a long loading screen
- It has an improved calibration system from the Lost Journey cyoa game
- There is a bug where if the minutes or seconds is set higher than 60 then they show up with the number entered
  - It goes back to normal after the number(s) go below 60 and still works fine
